- to activate the virtualenv, had to first enable scripting
    - with powershell as admin:
        - Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope LocalMachine
    - to undo:
        - Set-ExecutionPolicy Restricted -Scope LocalMachine
- then outside of an admin powershell session:
    - .\venv\Scripts\activate.ps1
    - which updates the command line interface (CLI) with the name of the virtualenv
    - to deactivate virtualenv can type:
        - deactivate
- I often use visual studio code as my IDE: https://code.visualstudio.com/
